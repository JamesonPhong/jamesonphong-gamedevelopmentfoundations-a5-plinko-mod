In order to play the game you must use the following controls:
A + D / Left and Right Arrow Key to move Left or Right.
Left Mouse Click / Space Bar to Shoot.
In order to win the game, you must first destroy the Shield by dropping the Energy Ball on either the Left or Right side of the Plinko Buckets.
After the Shield is destroyed, you can then attack the enemy Flagship directly by dropping the Energy Ball at the center of the Plinko Buckets.
Alternatively, you can skip destroying the Shield entirely by dropping the Energy Ball into the Moving Plinko Bucket, however it is very difficult to do so.
